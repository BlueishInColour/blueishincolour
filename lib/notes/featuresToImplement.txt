blueishincolour is or will be a suit making brand, and will want to fully operate online 
from order to delevery, 
4 screens; main shop, cart, blog, profile(wardrope) 


main = renders all document 
cart renders document by liked by a perticular user, ie doc has a list of likers, if user is in the list, fetch it
blog renders all document
profile renders documents where creator is the username
